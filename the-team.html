							<h3>Martha Durrett</h3>
							<p>Martha is a computer science/English double major at Carleton College, and, like many of
							her teammates, has found happiness in the digital humanities, a field that bridges the gap
							between her two majors. She works as a Digital Humanities Associate at Carleton, teaming up
							with fun and interdisciplinary groups of professors and students to work on a diverse range
							of innovative projects, and she hopes to pursue work in this field after graduation. When
							Martha isn't writing code or writing papers, she enjoys working in the dining hall as a dining
							hall manager, playing violin in the orchestra, and DJing for KRLX, Carleton's 24/7 radio station,
								where she was the general manager until Spring 2018. Martha would like to thank
								Eric Alexander, her marvelous group members, and King Radbod for working together wonderfully to get
							through this crazy thing called comps.</p>

							<h3>Bard Swallow</h3>
							<p>
								Bard came to Carleton imagining xe would end up an English or History major studying Medieval Europe,
								but after taking intro CS, Bard was hooked. Since then, xe has worked on the intersection of xyr interests:
								the Digital Humanities. Now that Bard has learned lots of Python shortcuts and overdosed on JavaScript,
								xe is looking forward to learning even more languages as xe begins an MA in Medieval Literatures
								and Languages at the University of York in the Fall. In xyr spare time, Bard enjoys playing any instrument
								xe can get xyr hands on, speaking in iambic pentameter, torturing xyr teammates with puns, playing
								mischievous characters in tabletop rpgs, reading Science Fiction and Fantasy novels, and singing Child Ballads.
								Bard would like to thank xyr family, friends, the entirety of Benton (sci-fi and fantasy interest) House,
								xyr boyfriend Galen, and xyr collection of Latin dictionaries that helped name the project&mdash;runner-ups include
								<em>lacticinium</em> ("food prepared with milk"), <em>latrunculus</em> ("little bandit"), <em>ludibrium</em> ("mockery"), or <em>lipsanotheca</em> ("a storehouse for relics").

							<h3>Sam Wiseman</h3>
							<p>
							A Connecticut native, Sam fully expected his world to turn upside down when he flew out
							to Minnesota for college. However, he never could have guessed that he'd become another
							one of intro CS's hapless victims and major in the subject! He loves studying it because
							it lets him look at other topics in a whole new light; as such, a comps project within
							the digital humanities was great fun for him. When he's not chunking documents or
							fine-tuning his word clouds, Sam enjoys life as a music double major and French minor. He
							plays the piano and violin and hopes to continue doing so after moving to Wisconsin to start
							work as a software developer. He'd like to thank his supportive family, wonderful friends,
							and amazing comps group for a fun and fulfilling senior year.
